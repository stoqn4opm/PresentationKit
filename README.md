# PresentationKit
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0.0-brightgreen.svg)

PresentationKit is a micro iOS Dynamic Framework with the single purpose of presenting `UIViewController`'s, from places within your code where you don't have reference to app's view controller hierarchy. A nice example of use case of this library is from within other libraries that need to present an authentication flow and dismiss it on completion. 

Build using Swift 5.3, Xcode 12.4, supports iOS 12.0+

# Usage

1. import module **PresentationKit** in the file you want to use the framework
2. On a `UIViewController` instance you now will be able to call `present(animated:, completion:)` and the view controller will be presented in a new `UIWindow` on top of all other `UIWindow`'s.
3. When you are done, call `dismiss(animated:, completion:)` on the presented `UIViewController` and the newly created `UIWindow` will be destroyed leaving the user interface in the intial state.
